### Statistical genetics and metascience

#### Coming January 2025...

Richard Border is starting as an assistant professor in the Department of Computational Biology at the Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science starting his lab in **January 2025**. He studies problems at the intersections of human genetics, statistics, quantitative psychology, and applied mathematics (unfortunately, he writes in the third person). His primary research interests include:

1. Nonrandom mating and other forms of population structure, particularly how they impact inference about genetic architecture

2. Scalable Bayesian inference and other methods for the efficient and flexible analysis and simulation of genome-wide data.

3. Metascience, measurement, model misspecification, and sensitivity analysis. 

I am moving to Carnegie Mellon University to start my lab in January 2025. In the meantime, I'm working with Noah Zaitlen in the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine Neurology Department and Sriram Sankararaman in the UCLA Computer Science Department.
