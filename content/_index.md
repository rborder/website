I am moving to Carnegie Mellon University to start my lab in January 2025 as an assistant professor in the Department of Computational Biology. In the meantime, I'm working with Noah Zaitlen in the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine Neurology Department and Sriram Sankararaman in the UCLA Computer Science Department.
