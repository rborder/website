  abstract: "The contribution of epistasis (interactions among genes or genetic variants) to human complex trait variation remains poorly understood. Methods that aim to explicitly identify pairs of genetic variants, usually single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), associated with a trait suffer from low power due to the large number of hypotheses tested while also having to deal with the computational problem of searching over a potentially large number of candidate pairs. An alternate approach involves testing whether a single SNP modulates variation in a trait against a polygenic background. While overcoming the limitation of low power, such tests of polygenic or marginal epistasis (ME) are infeasible on Biobank-scale data where hundreds of thousands of individuals are genotyped over millions of SNPs.

  We present a method to test for ME of a SNP on a trait that is applicable to biobank-scale data. We performed extensive simulations to show that our method provides calibrated tests of ME. We applied our method to test for ME at SNPs that are associated with 53 quantitative traits across ≈ 300 K unrelated white British individuals in the UK Biobank (UKBB). Testing 15, 601 trait-loci associations that were significant in GWAS, we identified 16 trait-loci pairs across 12 traits that demonstrate strong evidence of ME signals (p-value $p<\\frac{5\times10^{-8}}{53}). We further partitioned the significant ME signals across the genome to identify 6 trait-loci pairs with evidence of local (within-chromosome) ME while 15 show evidence of distal (cross-chromosome) ME. Across the 16 trait-loci pairs, we document that the proportion of trait variance explained by ME is about 12x as large as that explained by the GWAS effects on average (range: 0.59 to 43.89). Our results show, for the first time, evidence of interaction effects between individual genetic variants and overall polygenic background modulating complex trait variation."
