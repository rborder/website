## Richard Border

Postdoctoral researcher in statistical genetics at UCLA. Supervised by Noah Zaitlen in the DGSOM Department of Neurology and Sriram Sankararaman in Department of Computer Science.

Iâ€™m interested in population structure, computational mathematics, and metascience.

I also like rock climbing and my dog Buckminster. In general, I prefer dogs to humans. Linux user.
