## Introductions 

My name is Richard. I'm a PhD candidate in statistical genetics at the University of Colorado Boulder. 

I'm interested in statistics, statistical genetics, applied mathematics, measurement, and metascience.

I also like rock climbing and my dog Buckminster. Dogs >> humans. Linux user.
