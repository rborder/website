## Introductions 

My name is Richard. I'm a graduate student at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I'mursuing a PhD in behavioral genetics and an MS in applied math. I'm interested in statistics, statistical genetics, and metascience. I also like rock climbing and my dog Buckminster. Pro-animal, anti-human. Cynic.
