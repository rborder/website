## Introductions 

My name is Richard. I'm a graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder. I'm pursuing a PhD in behavioral genetics and an MS in applied math. 

I'm interested in statistics, statistical genetics, measurement, and metascience.

I also like rock climbing and my dog Buckminster. Dogs > humans. Linux user. Cynic.
