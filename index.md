## Introductions 

My name is Richard. I'm a graduate student at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I'm pursusing a PhD in behavioral genetics and an MS in applied math. I'm interested in statistics, human development, and metascience. I also like climbing rocks and hanging out with my dog Buckmister.
