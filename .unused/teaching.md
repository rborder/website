# Teaching Materials

Here are various (old) web apps and handouts I've created for various classes I've taught or for fun. I take full responsibility for any and all errors (of which there are likely many).

- [Random Walk Generator](https://buckminster.shinyapps.io/randomWalks)
- [Visualizing Squared Error](https://buckminster.shinyapps.io/squaredError_visualizer)
- [False Discovery Rate Curve](https://buckminster.shinyapps.io/FalseDiscoveryRate)
- [Diagnostic Plot Generator (unfinished)](https://buckminster.shinyapps.io/diagnositicPlots)
- [A perspective on multiple regression](teachingMaterials/multipleRegressionResiduals.pdf)
- [Graphing ANOVA results using R](teachingMaterials/anovaGraphingDemo.pdf)
- [Testing simple effects in ANOVA](testingSimpleEffectsANOVA.pdf)
